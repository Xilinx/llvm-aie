# This tests the behavior of the scheduler with edges created by "dynamic"
# implicit operands.

# TODO: Those edges should probably be removed altogether, they are not required
# for correctness as the scheduling graph already deals with aliasing registers,
# but they potentially reduce parallelism.

# Due to the implicit-def, there is a RAW dependency between $x0 and $wh0.
# The edge gets a default latency of 0, the instructions can issue in parallel.
