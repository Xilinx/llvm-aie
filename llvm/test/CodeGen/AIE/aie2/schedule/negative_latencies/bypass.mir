# VMAC reads its accumulator input in E3 and writes in E5
# There is a WAR edge of -1 (= 3 - 5 + BypassedCycles) latency between the two
# VMAC instructions. Here, we verify that the second VMAC is scheduled AT MOST
# one cycle before the first one. If we ever get the schedule below, the anti-dep
# would not be respected and we have a broken schedule.
#   VMAC cm0, cm2, ...
#   NOP
#   VMAC cm1, cm0, ...  <--- WRONG: Bypass taken, we already read the new cm0
