# Tests the MOV slot bypass (MOV_Bypass)
# This is particular looks at bypasses behavior for the wl and wh register
# files. Most instructions involved in MOV_Bypass use X registers, but some
# like VMOV and VCONV actually use W registers. For those, we have to make sure
# that the bypass isn't used for WH registers, as it isn't supported in HW.
