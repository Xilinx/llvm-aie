# CHECK: error: ran out of registers during register allocation

# A funny example where Greedy does not bother inflating %2's regclass to eR.
# It shouldn't happen in real code because ISel will not constrain %2 to eR29
# unless it is consumed by a eR29 operand, which isn't the case.
# If it was consumed by a eR29 operand, Greedy would understand why it was
# constrained in the first place, and would inflate the class + insert COPY
# instructions. See inflate-er-subclasses.mir
